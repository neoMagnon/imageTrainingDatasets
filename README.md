# imageTrainingDatasets
pretty much what it sounds like


will be adding 
1. 20 different classes of wild animals
2. Human and non human faces (including pics of 'photo's and pictures' as a subset of non-human faces)


*for now the custom algo wont be able to extract features with minimal data - but keep it benched untill the right evAlgo is found
