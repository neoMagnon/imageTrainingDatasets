Feature embeddings are still a far cry away from actual feature encoding as per the bio-neural architecture
for now a max of 128D is the constraint for meaningful yet computationally gentle feature formalization

for now the basic task of feature similarity has been met via the code given
...but there is definitely room for improvement in terms of feature detection architecture
